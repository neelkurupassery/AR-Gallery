# AR-Gallery
 
  Welcome to the AR Gallery Project.

 The first step would be to clone the project from github to a local folder. This can be done with the git command line command "git clone". 
 Secondly, one needs Unity and Vuforia. Specifically, the Vuforia 8.6.7 package must be imported. This is because the file-size was > 100 MB. 
 
 Unity: unity.com
 Vuforia: https://developer.vuforia.com/ 
 
 Within the Unity Hub, you should first "Add Project", and select the AR Gallery Folder. Then once Vuforia is imported, click "Play". 
 
Limitations include lighting affecting the angles at which the images are recognized, and the button functionality depending on the angle of the camera. The code works best when one is directly facing the object.
